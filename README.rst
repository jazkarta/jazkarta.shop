---------------

Installation
============

Currently, there is no PYPI release, so the git repository has to be added to
a Plone buildout as a source. The following is a minimal example that will do
that and leave Plone ready to use jazkarta.shop.

Create a directory called Plone-5 and enter it::

    mkdir Plone-5
    cd Plone-5

Create a virtual python environment (virtualenv) and install zc.buildout::

    virtualenv zinstance --python=python2.7
    cd zinstance
    source bin/activate
    bin/pip install zc.buildout

Create a buildout.cfg file with the following contents::

    [buildout]
    extends =
        http://dist.plone.org/release/5-latest/versions.cfg

    parts =
        instance

    extensions =
        mr.developer

    always-checkout = force

    auto-checkout =
        jazkarta.shop

    [sources]
    jazkarta.shop = git git@github.com:jazkarta/jazkarta.shop.git

    [versions]
    # For python 2.7 compatibility
    premailer = 3.6.2
    cachetools = 3.1.1
    # Plone 5.1
    requests = 2.24
    cryptography=3.3.2
    cssutils=1.0.2

    setuptools=44.1.1
    zc.buildout=2.13.4

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    user = admin:admin
    http-address = 8080
    eggs =
        Plone
        Products.validation
        Products.Archetypes
        Products.contentmigration
        archetypes.schemaextender
        jazkarta.shop

Change the `5-latest` version in the `extends` directive above to use a different
Plone version. This buildout should work on both 5.1 and 5.2 deployments.

Change the version pin of zc.buildout and setuptools to match the version that running bin/pip command pulled in, eg:

    Using cached zc.buildout-2.13.4-py2.py3-none-any.whl (153 kB)
    Requirement already satisfied: setuptools<52,>=8.0 in ./lib/python2.7/site-packages (from zc.buildout) (44.1.1)


Run buildout::

    ./bin/buildout

This will start a long download and build process.

You can ignore Errors like SyntaxError: ("'return' outside function"...".

After it finished you can start Plone in foreground-mode with::

    ./bin/instance fg

You can stop it with ctrl + c.

Start and stop this Plone-instance in production-mode like this::

    ./bin/instance start

    ./bin/instance stop

Plone will run on port 8080. You can access your install via http://localhost:8080.

Use login id “admin” and password “admin” for initial login so you can create a site.


Integrating the Package with Your Content
=========================================

To make your content types addable to your cart, implementing the IProduct interface is required::

    from jazkarta.shop.interfaces import IProduct

    class Journal(Container):
         implements(IJournal, IProduct)

Administration
==============

Three control panels are provided.

Jazkarta Shop Settings
----------------------

This control panel allows configuration of:

- Which payment processor to use
- Payment processor keys or login information for development and production use
- Subject and introduction for receipt emails
- Product categories
- Minimum stock level
- Shipped from name and address
- Shipping handler keys or login information
- Which tax handler to use
- Optional Taxjar API token
- Optional after-checkout callback URL

jazkarta.shop requires the environment variable ``JAZKARTA_SHOP_ENV`` to be set to ``production`` when it is running in production mode.

Jazkarta Shop Shipping Methods
------------------------------

Named shipping methods can be added and edited. Each shipping method specifies the geographical areas it is used for, the shipping fee calculation method, minimum and maximum weights, and optionally a minimum purchase amount.

Jazkarta Shop Orders
--------------------

This control panel provides a table of order information such as date, items, shipping information and price.
